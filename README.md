This bot will update hourly depending on if there is any new content.

This code is not endorsed(at least that we know of) or in any way related to Auckland Council and at any point they could by no fault of there own break our bot.
If they do we will likely know and work to fix the issue but we cannot give any guarantees.

Any issues create a issue in the issue tab above. Pull Requests welcome.

Forked from the code from https://github.com/geocom/akl_infocouncil_twitter_bot
